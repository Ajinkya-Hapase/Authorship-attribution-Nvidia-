# Authorship-attribution-Nvidia
Authorship attribution is a type of text classification problem. Instead of categorizing text by topic, as in the disease text classification problem, the objective is to classify the text by author.
The Problem
The Federalist Papers - History Mystery!
The Federalist Papers are a set of essays written between 1787 and 1788 by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay. Initially published under the pseudonym 'Publius', their intent was to encourage the ratification of the then-new Constitution of the United States of America. In later years, a list emerged where the author of each one of the 85 papers was identified. Nevertheless, for a subset of these papers the author is still in question. The problem of the Federalist Papers authorship attribution has been a subject of much research in statistical NLP in the past. Now you will try to solve this question with your own BERT-based project model.Image

In concrete terms, the problem is identifying, for each one of the disputed papers, whether Alexander Hamilton or James Madison are the authors. For this exercise, you can assume that each paper has a single author, i.e., that no collaboration took place (though that is not 100% certain!), and that each author has a well-defined writing style that is displayed across all the identified papers.
